# Polynomial Regression with K-Fold Cross-Validation

**Goal:** Evaluate polynomial regression models of degrees **{1, 2, 3, 4}** using **k-fold cross-validation**, report **MSE** (mean ± std) and **R²**, and select the best degree by **lowest mean MSE**.

This is a compact, exam-grade **Data Science Analysis Project**:
- Clear problem definition
- Robust modeling & evaluation (CV)
- Reproducibility (tests & CI)
- Best practices (OOP, pipelines, code style)

---

## Features
- Degrees evaluated: 1, 2, 3, 4 (configurable)
- **K-Fold CV** with shuffling and fixed seeds
- Metrics: **MSE** (selection), **R²** (interpretability)
- OOP class: `PolynomialKFoldCV`
- Test suite (pytest)
- GitHub Actions CI
- Pre-commit hooks (Black, isort, Flake8)

---

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/tp3-polynomial-cv.git
cd tp3-polynomial-cv
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

---

## Optional (recommended):
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install

---

## Quickstart
# Run with synthetic data:
python TP3_kfold_polynomial_cv.py

---

# Run with your own CSV (must contain columns x,y):
python TP3_kfold_polynomial_cv.py --csv examples/sample_xy.csv --k 5 --degrees 1 2 3 4

---

# Flags:

   * --csv PATH Load CSV with columns x,y (optional)

   * --k INT Number of folds (default: 5)

   * --degrees D1 D2 ... Degrees to evaluate (default: 1 2 3 4)

   * --seed INT Random seed (default: 42)

   * --no-shuffle Disable shuffling before folding

---

# Output example:
=== K-Fold CV Summary (lower MSE is better) ===
 degree  mse_mean  mse_std  r2_mean  r2_std
      2    0.3612   0.0815   0.9287   0.0229
      3    0.3725   0.0891   0.9260   0.0241
      4    0.3884   0.0972   0.9225   0.0269
      1    1.9821   0.3746   0.5012   0.0813

Best degree by mean MSE: 2

---

## Tests
pytest -q

---

## Data format
Provide a CSV with two columns:

x,y
-3.0,-2.1
-2.9,-1.8
...

A sample is in examples/sample_xy.csv.

---
